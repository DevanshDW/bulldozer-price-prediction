# ðŸšœ Bulldozer Price Prediction Project

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the sale price of bulldozers. The project follows a structured approach to solve a regression problem using Python and various machine learning libraries.

## Project Overview

### Problem Definition
In this project, we aim to predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how similar bulldozers have been sold for.

### Data
The data used in this project is from the Blue Book for Bulldozers competition on Kaggle. It includes information on the sale price of bulldozers sold at auctions, alongside various characteristics of the bulldozers.

### Evaluation
The project's goal is to build a machine learning model that minimizes the root mean squared log error (RMSLE) between the actual and predicted auction prices.

### Features
The dataset contains features like model type, size, usage metrics, and more, which are detailed in the Features section of this repository.

## Methodology

- Data preprocessing, including parsing dates and sorting by sale date.
- Splitting the data into training and validation sets.
- Filling missing values and converting categorical data into a machine-readable format.
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.
- Evaluation of the best model on the validation set.
- Feature importance analysis.

## Results
The final model demonstrates the capability to predict bulldozer prices with a certain accuracy level, measured by the RMSLE on the validation set. The detailed results and model performance metrics are included within the notebook.

## Dependencies
The project is built using Python, with key dependencies including Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.

## How to Use
- Clone this repository.
- Install the required dependencies.
- Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the project's approach, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
